## Overview

This program is an interactive quiz designed to help users assess compatibility based on various questions related to personal preferences. After taking the quiz, users will be provided with a score that reflects their preferences, and their answers will be saved for future reference. The results are stored in a file, making it easy to track how many people have taken the quiz and their average scores.

## Purpose of the Quiz

The goal of this quiz is to help individuals understand their personal preferences better and to help them match those preferences with potential partners. The quiz asks questions about various aspects such as:
- Gender preferences
- Age ranges
- Relationship preferences (long-term vs short-term)
- Lifestyle preferences (e.g., introvert, extrovert)
- Hobbies and interests (e.g., movies, books)

The responses are used to calculate a compatibility score. This can be a fun way to explore the qualities individuals seek in a partner or simply to gain insight into their own preferences.

## Installation & Requirements

The program is written in **Python** and requires Python 3.x. You also need the `json` module, which is included in Python's standard library.

### Steps to Run the Program:

1. **Download the Program**:
   - Download the `quiz_program.py` file and save it to your local directory.

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `quiz_program.py` is located.
   - Run the program by typing:
     ```bash
     python quiz_program.py
     ```

   If Python 3.x is your default version, you can simply use `python`. Otherwise, you may need to use `python3` if it's installed as a separate version.

3. **Interact with the Program**:
   - The program will prompt you to enter your name and then begin asking a series of questions.
   - For each question, you will need to enter your answer (using letters like `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.).
   - After completing all the questions, the program will provide you with a score and save your responses to a file.

## How the Program Works

### 1. **Loading Previous Results**:
   - When the program starts, it will check if there is an existing file called `quiz_results.json`. If the file exists, it will load the data from the file and show you the number of people who have taken the quiz, along with the average score.

### 2. **User Interaction**:
   - The program asks users a series of multiple-choice questions related to preferences and relationships. The user answers each question by selecting the appropriate letter (`a`, `b`, `c`, etc.).
   - After each answer, the program asks how important that question is to the user on a scale of 1 to 4.

### 3. **Saving Results**:
   - After completing the quiz, the user's name, answers, and score are stored in the `quiz_results.json` file for permanent storage. This allows the program to maintain a record of all users who have taken the quiz.

### 4. **Statistics**:
   - When the program starts, it shows how many people have completed the quiz and calculates the average score. This is useful for seeing trends and comparing scores between users.

## Detailed Explanation of Questions and Options

### 1. **Gender Preference**:
   - You are asked about your gender (male or female) and your preferred gender for a potential partner. This is a basic question that helps assess personal preferences.

### 2. **Age Range**:
   - This question asks for your age range and your preferred age range for a partner. It's designed to give a better idea of the age compatibility.

### 3. **Relationship Type**:
   - The quiz asks whether you are looking for a long-term or short-term relationship. This helps identify different preferences in terms of commitment.

### 4. **Introvert, Extrovert, or Ambivert**:
   - This question assesses whether you are more introverted, extroverted, or somewhere in between. This can affect compatibility, as people with different energy levels might have varying needs in social situations.

### 5. **Lifestyle Preferences**:
   - The quiz also asks about hobbies and preferences, such as whether you like movies, books, or both. These can be indicators of shared interests with a potential partner.
